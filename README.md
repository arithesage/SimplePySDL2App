# [WIP] Simple Python SDL2 App
A starting point for creating SDL2 applications with Python.

What makes this different from the Python SDL2 App?
In the other project i added Scenes, an AssetManager, an
Entity-Component system...

This one doesn't have any of these.

The idea is to have a starting point for sketching an application
or a game in the most simple way.

You will have a SDL2App class, a Utils module... and probably
nothing more to start.

If you want scenes, managers, etc... you will have to build these
yourself.
